# Interests
- description: Music is my passion. I have a small vinyl collection (about 50 records of different styles of music) and I really like to attend live or electronic concerts.
- description: My second interest is photography (especially travel and street). For the development of this skill, I finished a commercial photography course.
- description: I love cinema, my favorite genre is an art house. One of my dreams is to get to the Cannes Film Festival as a volunteer or spectator.
